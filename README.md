# Wildberries Laptop Sales Analysis 📊

This project focuses on analyzing laptop sales data from Wildberries, a major e-commerce platform. By examining key metrics such as price, discounts, reviews, ratings, and sales, we aim to uncover insights that can help businesses and consumers make informed decisions. The project also uses machine learning techniques such as K-means clustering to group laptops into different segments based on their features and performance.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Analyze laptop sales data on Wildberries to identify key trends and patterns.
- Perform clustering analysis to segment products based on pricing, sales, and other characteristics.
- Visualize insights through charts and graphs to make the findings more intuitive.
- Predict product success using key metrics like sales, ratings, and reviews.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms (K-means clustering).
- **WordCloud**: For generating visual word clouds from reviews and other textual data.
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing in sentiment and keyword analysis.

🚀 Usage
The project is presented in a Jupyter notebook, which contains the following sections:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and handling missing values, scaling, and preparation for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed analysis of price distribution, discounts, ratings, reviews, and sales.
K-means Clustering: Laptops are segmented into groups based on their characteristics (price, ratings, sales, etc.).
Visualization: Various graphs and plots to visualize data insights (e.g., sales trends, price-to-performance ratios).
Prediction Model (Future Work): Planned addition of a machine learning model to predict successful products based on current features.
🔢 Data Overview
The dataset includes the following key attributes:

Price: The base and discounted prices of the laptops.
Sales Volume: Total number of laptops sold.
Revenue: Total revenue generated from sales.
Discount: The percentage discount applied to the product.
Ratings & Reviews: Customer feedback metrics.
Inventory: Availability status of each product.
🔑 Key Features
Clustering of Laptops: Grouping products based on their price, discount, and performance metrics.
Sales & Revenue Analysis: Identification of top-selling laptops and trends over time.
Rating & Review Analysis: Assessing the correlation between ratings, reviews, and sales volume.
Price Sensitivity: Understanding how discounts affect sales performance.
📊 Visualizations
The project provides detailed visualizations, such as:

Revenue vs. Price Distribution: Visualizing how pricing impacts total revenue.
Sales Volume by Product Category: Identifying which categories perform the best.
Word Clouds: Extracting key terms from customer reviews to highlight common sentiments.
Cluster Analysis Plots: Visual representation of clustered products based on selected features.
